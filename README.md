# frequency_diff

The R code presented here calculates the probability that an observed allelic frequency differs from another given value.  These probabilities were used in:

The [*gst_prime* function](gst_prime.R) is written in base R, and requires vaues for the number of subpopulations *k*, the average subpopulation heterozygosity *H<sub>S</sub>* and the total population heterozygosity *H<sub>T</sub>*.  Usage is:

gst_prime(*k*, *H<sub>S</sub>*, *H<sub>T</sub>*)

Example: a study population containing 14 subpopulations with average subpopulation heterozygosity of 0.953 and total population heterozygosity of 0.981 would return:

```
gst_prime(14, 0.953, 0.981)
0.6518016
```
